# DnD-Initiative-Tracker 

###### (*Work in Progress! Will be fully usable in a day or two*)


### About this Initiative Tracker

###### This program is something I decided I wanted to build for myself to help with running games of Dungeons and Dragons for my friends. One of the most tedious things about running a game is keeping track of the order in which everybody takes their turn during combat, and I saw this as something I could absolutely automate! Along the way, I decided that I might as well make it fun to look at, and I think this has turned into something that other people can definitely get some enjoyment out of. If it sounds like something you may want to use or tell your Dungeon Master about, please keep reading as I explain the basics of how to use it :)

### First Steps
The first thing the program will prompt you to do is to enter the names of each party memeber in your current session (I recommend taking care of this step before the game starts if you want to save time). Once you've entered everyone's character, enter 'continue' and the program will advance to it's main loop.

###### From here I've selected option 1, which you will do when you begin combat. All you need to do is enter the name of each monster, followed by it's dexterity modifier, and the roll will be taken care of for you instantly!

######  Once you're finished, enter 'continue' just as before, and it's time for the fun part:

### Ask players for initiative

###### At this point, all we have to do is take every player's initiative in the order that we entered their names originally, and the initiative for that combat will be sorted and tracked! You can cycle through them with an entry of '1', and of course you can take creatures out of combat if they flee or fall to 0, or add them in if your players are making quick work of your big epic boss and you need to send them some support!

### Getting the .exe!

###### If you'd like to play with this tool, know that you currently only select option 1 once you're in combat, so you'll just have to close the program once you're done playing with it. But I'll be updating this in probably the next day, and so hopefully nobody even reads this part of the README ðŸ˜… BUT! If you are curious, you'll want to go to the green button labeled 'code' up at the top of this repo page, and either download/extract the zip, or clone it if you're familiar with git. From the root directory, navigate to  **x64 < Release**  and you will find the .exe there waiting for you!
